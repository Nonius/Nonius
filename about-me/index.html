<p>I like to learn about programming languages with unique features. Mainly focusing on type systems. So I find <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and <a href="https://www.idris-lang.org">Idris2</a> really interesting. But I also find <a href="https://www.unisonweb.org/">Unison</a> a really interesting language. I also like the LISP syntax.</p>
<h2 id="i-like-to-play-music-but-i-can-t">I like to play music (but I can't)</h2>
<p>I have spent some time to learn to play the guitar and the bass and now I'm on a journey with the piano.</p>
<h2 id="i-like-sports">I like sports</h2>
<p>Basketball, running, bouldering, clubbells, horse back riding</p>
<h2 id="i-like-animals">I like animals</h2>
<p>I'm a crazy cat lady</p>
<h2 id="steno">Steno</h2>
<p>I want to switch to a chorded keyboard, but I'm only at the speed of 13-15WPM now, so I'm just practicing for now. I plan to fully switch if I'm around 30WPM.</p>
