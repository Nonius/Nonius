## I'm a bit of geek
I like to learn about programming languages with unique features. Mainly focusing on type systems. So I find [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Idris2](https://www.idris-lang.org) really interesting. But I also find [Unison](https://www.unisonweb.org/) a really interesting language. I also like the LISP syntax.
## I like to play music (but I can't)
I have spent some time to learn to play the guitar and the bass and now I'm on a journey with the piano.
## I like sports
Basketball, running, bouldering, clubbells, horse back riding
## I like animals
I'm a crazy cat lady
## Steno
I want to switch to a chorded keyboard, but I'm only at the speed of 13-15WPM now, so I'm just practicing for now. I plan to fully switch if I'm around 30WPM.
